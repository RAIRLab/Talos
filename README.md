An automated theorem prover for the DCEC*, the Deontic Cognitive Event Calculus designed at RAIR Labs at RPI, which can be found [here](http://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/projects/the-deontic-cognitive-event-calculus-dcec/)

This is built upon the SPASS system which can be found here: [http://www.spass-prover.org/](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/automation-of-logic/software/spass-workbench/)

It is written in python and uses the DCEC_Library which can be found [here](https://github.com/RAIRLab/DCEC_Library)

An online version of this prover with great documentation can be found at: [https://prover.cogsci.rpi.edu/DCEC_PROVER/](https://prover.cogsci.rpi.edu/DCEC_PROVER/)
